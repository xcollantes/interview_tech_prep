## Definitions

Stable sort type:
Elements with identical values are sorted in the same order.  For example,
in an array `[4, 6, 4, 1, 0]`, the sorted form would be `[0, 1, 4, 4, 6]`.  
A stable algorithm would sort the array with the duplicate values in the same order
where the first 4 in the unsorted array also comes first in the sorted array.  

Usually in sorting, we don't differentiate with duplicate values.  But in
practice, the duplicate numbers could represent something (like being tied to
some address).

### Trees

### Graphs

Graph:
Collection of nodes connected by edges.  

Vertex:
A single node in a graph.  

Edge:
Connection between two vertices.

Directed graph: Graph where the edges are in only one direction as opposed
to nodes where the edge is two way.  

Acylical graph:
